Notes:

[0]  The IPv6 address management function was formally delegated to
     IANA in December 1995 [RFC1881].

[1]  The "unspecified address", the "loopback address", and the IPv6
     Addresses with Embedded IPv4 Addresses are assigned out of the
     0000::/8 address block.

[2]  0200::/7 was previously defined as an OSI NSAP-mapped prefix set
     [RFC4548]. This definition has been deprecated as of December
     2004 [RFC4048].

[3]  The IPv6 Unicast space encompasses the entire IPv6 address range
     with the exception of FF00::/8. [RFC4291] IANA unicast address
     assignments are currently limited to the IPv6 unicast address
     range of 2000::/3. IANA assignments from this block are registered
     in the IANA registry: iana-ipv6-unicast-address-assignments.

[4]  FEC0::/10 was previously defined as a Site-Local scoped address
     prefix. This definition has been deprecated as of September 2004
     [RFC3879].

[5]  0000::/96 was previously defined as the "IPv4-compatible IPv6
     address" prefix.  This definition has been deprecated by [RFC4291].
