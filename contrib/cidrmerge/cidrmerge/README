1 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT

Purpose of this program is to export a library and a program to realize the CIDR optimization.
CIDR optimization means given the input A find out an equivalen output B that contains the as small as possible number of lines.
Additionally program/library can apply a whitelist to the input CIDR: that means that taken and input CIDR A and a whitelist CIDR B the output C will be the optimized version of A minus all networks contained by B.

The program has been widely used for blacklist optimization: you can put together many blacklist, apply your own whitelist and obtain the optimized version of input files. It works perfectly in conjunction with rbldns (http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/rbldns.html). Many big ISP are currently using it.

It can be used under certain conditions for reducing number of lines of ACLs or routing tables.

Performances
The alghoritm in both optimization cases (with and without whitelist) is executed with the N*log(N) complexity due to sorting alghoritm. The sort is realized using C qsort function. Memory usage depends on operations performed and it can be quite high in case of nasty blacklist/whitelist combination. Anyway has been proven to support millions network as input without any big trouble.

Usage
cidrmerge -h|-v|[whitelist file] [NOOPTIMIZE]
-v		Print version number and exit
-h		Print small help hints and exit
[whitelist file] CIDR format file containing whitelist 
[NOOPTIMIZE] will apply the whitelist but will not cidrmerge the output. Useful for debug purposes

Return code: 0 on success, > 0 in case of error

Optimization Example
A (Taken from standard input)
10.1.1.0/24
10.1.1.1/32
192.1.4.5/32
192.1.4.4/32
B
10.1.1.0/24
192.1.4.3/31

Whitelist Example
A (Taken from standard input)
10.1.1.0/24
10.1.1.1/32

B (read as input file)
192.1.4.4/32
10.1.1.128/31
C
10.1.1.0/25
10.1.1.130/31
10.1.1.132/30
10.1.1.136/29
10.1.1.144/28
10.1.1.160/27

192.1.4.5/32


2 PROJECT COMPONENTS

This programs consist of some part
- the optimization library: The library offer core functionality that can be used by programmers to build their own programs. It can be used as shared library or statically linked
- the optimization program: an implementaton that read CIDR formatted lines and output CIDR formatted lines, using core library function accordingly
- two utility script: one to convert network form addresses (network/netmask) to CIDR called netmasktocidr.pl and the opposite, called cidrtonetmask.pl

BUILD
A C compiler is needed (tested with gcc 2.95, 3.2 and 3.3). Simply type make will work in most cases. In case gcc is not into path, please modify makefile accordingly.
To compile shared library, please use "make lib".
